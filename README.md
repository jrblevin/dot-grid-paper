# Dot Grid Paper

These are PDF templates for 0.25 inch dot grid paper in US letter format.

## Overview

Since they are in PDF format, the are useful for:

*   Printing your own dot grid paper
*   Templates in apps such as [GoodNotes][] ([iOS][], [macOS][])

Several variations are included:

*   _Orientation:_ portrait and landscape
*   _Margin:_ top margin or full grid
*   _Color:_ white or "antique"

## Package Contents

*   `dot-grid.sty` - A LaTeX package which defines colors, margins, and a dot grid macro using TikZ.
*   `dot-grid.py` - A Python script which generates the TeX files.

## Usage

1.   Run `dot-grid.py` to produce the `.tex` files directly into the tex directory.
2.   Run `pdflatex` on each `.tex` file as needed.  For example:

         for file in tex/*.tex; do pdflatex $file; done;

     This will create the pdfs in the root directory.

Or, simply use the included output files in the `pdf` directory.

## Specifications
